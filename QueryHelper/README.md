# "Select By Attributes" Query Helper (ESRI REST Diagnostics)

On the ArcGIS Server REST Query page for a layer, this bookmarklet presents the fields and SQL keywords in a useful form on the side of the page.

## Features

The bookmarklet renders a control on the side of the page that lists field names, values, and SQL keywords on the side of an ArcGIS Server REST Service layer query page. As you select field names, it retrieves a list of valid values and populates the second selection list.

## Instructions

### Installation

Installation on the browser is as simple as adding a bookmark. From the [ESRI Rest Diagnostics](http://raykendo.github.io/ESRI_REST_Diagnostics/) page...

- Chrome: drag the anchor link to your browser toolbar.
- Firefox: right-click on the link and select "Bookmark this link".
- IE: right-click on the link and select "Add to Favorites".
- Safari: untested.
- Opera: drag the anchor link to your browser toolbar. 

### Basic Use

Navigate to an ArcGIS Server REST service endpoint in your browser. Drill down to a Map Service or a Feature Service layer, [like this US Census State layer](http://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Census/MapServer/3/query). Call the bookmarklet from your bookmark bar, and let it run.

The bookmarklet will show a form in the upper right hand corner that lists the field names by alias, as well as SQL keywords used in queries. Selecting a field from the list will populate whatever text blank you had selected previously with the field name. It will also request a list of valid results, and fill them in a second selection list. Clicking on any list or button will fill the last text blank you selected with field names, results, and SQL keywords.

## Requirements

- Desktop browser (IE10+, Chrome, Firefox)
- Security settings that support bookmarklets.
- Access to an ArcGIS Server REST endpoint in browser.

## Notes

- Currently untested on Safari. Please give me feedback if you try it.
- Not tested on mobile/tablet browsers, since I'm not sure how bookmarklets work with those.
